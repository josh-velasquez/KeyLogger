# KeyLogger
This is for educational purpose only.
If the keylogger does not work, you might need to update your microsoft Windows SDK.

What does it do?
- This key logger can log user inputs in the background of a Windows machine without the user knowing
- Once the alloted time is reached, it will automatically create a .txt file on the Desktop of the user containing the logged inputs 
- The key logger is hidden in the background of the windows and it cannot be detected by the Task Manager 

Limitations:
- Currently, some key strokes cannot be recorder (ex. symbols and such)
