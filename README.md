# KeyLogger
Can log keys discretely in the background of windows machines.

# Running the application 
A sample release build can found under the Sample Execute File Directory.
Otherwise, you can run this in visual studio.

# Modes
Normal mode:
When the application starts up, the normal mode is launched. In here as soon as you start start record you can 
start typing anywhere and every keystroke will be recorded in the space provided.

Ninja Mode:
When you click Ninja Mode, a new window will pop up. Here it will prompt you for the duration for which you want 
the keylogging session will last. You can select which unit of time and simply hit start.
Once the time is reached, this will produce a .txt file (the file name will have the date and the time it was created) 
under your Desktop directory.
NOTE:
When in this mode, the application will hide itself and will not be visible on your tray icons nor in 
task manager. The only way the program will close is when it reaches the time allotted or a shutdown or restart 
of the system.
